The specified directory is intended to contain icon files, which are typically image files (like PNG, JPG, etc.). Since you haven't provided specific icon files to include, I will create a placeholder file to indicate that this directory is meant for icons.

Here are the contents for the file:

/simulacion-hilos/simulacion-hilos/src/assets/icons/README.txt

This file is intentionally left blank.
